# Silent Firebase Database update() Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in using Firebase's `update()` method.  When providing data with an incorrect structure (e.g., attempting to create nested objects where they don't exist), the operation fails silentlyâ€”no error is thrown, and the database remains unchanged.  This can be hard to debug.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect usage.  `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that includes robust error handling and ensures data integrity.

## How to reproduce

1.  Set up a Firebase project.
2.  Install the Firebase JavaScript SDK.
3.  Run `bug.js`. Observe that no error is logged, and no changes occur in the database.
4.  Run `bugSolution.js`. Observe proper error handling and correct data updates.
